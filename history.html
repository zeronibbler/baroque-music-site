    <h2>History of Baroque Music</h2>
    <!-- introductory paragraph -->
    <p>
        The Baroque period spans roughly from 1600 to 1750. It was a period of expression, with dramatic intensity, intense decoration, and emotionality in music. Composers of the era started experimented with new concepts, unknonwn to the public up to then. Contrast, ornamentation, and expressive melodies were added to music as compositional techniques that create emotional mobility to the listeners. One of the defining features of Baroque music is the <b>basso continuo</b>, which is the term that describes the continuous harmonic melody on the background accompanying, usually played by a harpsichord or another organ alongside a cello or the Baroque violin. Basso continuo installed a sense of structure and richness to the compositions.

    <p>
        Counterpoint and ornamentation were the most essential additions to the compositions: complex melodic lines create intricate textures, "trills", "turns", and "grace notes" gave a sense of a new elegance and flair to the music. At that time, music was prominent in the courtly life, religious ceremonies, and public entertainment, while reflecting the social hierarchy of the time. The social hierarchy of the time was from top to bottom, the Monarchy, then the aristocracy, then the Church, then the burgeoisie, the professionals like musicians, and lastly the peasantry. Baroque music was often in the service of the royalty and the church, classifying it as a form of artistic expression but also a display of social prestige.
    <p>
    Notable works of the Baroque era that are examples of the ingenuity and brilliance of the music  are Bach’s Brandenburg Concertos, Vivaldi’s The Four Seasons, Handel’s Messiah, Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas, and Corelli’s violin sonatas. These compositions are a must remember for music students as they point out the creative spirit, the technical mastery of the composers, and the expressive power that continues to be accepted by the audience today.
    </p>

    <p>
        These masterpieces are indicative of the era's contrast, virtuosity, and expressiveness. But furthermore beyond these compositional techniques Baroque music was deeply connected to the politics and culture of the time. Music across Europe was used in courts to display their power and prestige. At the same time, instruments evolved really rapidly in order to meet the demands of the complex compositions composers introduced, and performance practice emphasized both precision and expressive interpretation. Another memorable fact is the rise of opera as we know it today, with a central form, the drama and poetry, and the music that formed accordingly.

    <h3>What are the core elements of baroque music?</h3>
    <p>
    The core element of the Baroque period is the belief that music is a form of communication that evokes emotions to the audience. This idea of using music to communicate and evoke emotions was inherited directly from the Renaissance era. But composing music in the Baroque era carried a deliberate intention to touch the heart of listeners.
    The composer Claudio Monteverdi in 1605 explained that initially, harmony and counterpoint were given preference over the lyrics of the music in the Baroque period but, with time, the focus shifted to the lyrics to communicate as intended correctly to the audience. This later became dominant throughout the Baroque music era.

        <p>The basic Baroque musical forms are:</p>

        <!-- an unordered list -->
        <ul>
            <li>concerto</li>
            <li>sonata</li>
            <li>opera</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            which added complexity and drama to musical composition. <b>Counterpoint</b> is one of the most memorable Baroque insertions, meaning multiple independent melodic lines played at once, which is one of the most memorable contributions of Bach's, and dramatic contrasts.
        Also, during this period a new tonal system was established, that is the major/minor tonal system that is now the system with which Western music understands music with.
        Furthermore, there is increased complexity and ornamentation as music becomes richer and more complex, with composers adding complex melodic lines and decorative ornamentation to their work.
