            <h3>Harpsichord</h3>
            <p>The harpsichord was a keyboard instrument, similar to the modern piano, widely used for basso continuo and solo pieces.
                This instrument had plucked strings in order to produce a bright and articulate sound.
                It was the essential instrument for accompaniment and solo works.

            <h3>Organ</h3>
            <p>This imposing instrument was often used in churches. The organ could produce a rich, sustained sound that filled large spaces with majestic harmonies.
                Its multiple keyboards allowed performers to play complex polyphonic music, making it ideal for congregational liturgical pieces.
                Composers like J.S. Bach wrote some of their most celebrated organ compositions specifically for church services.

            <h3>Baroque Violin</h3>
            <p>The Baroque violin differed from modern violins with gut strings and a shorter, convex bow, producing a softer,
                nuanced tone that emphasized expressive sounds. It was central to concertos, sonatas, and orchestral works.

            <h3>Baroque Viola</h3>
            <p>Similar to the violin but slightly larger, providing a rich middle voice in ensembles and a warm tone that filled the middle
                range in ensembles. It often played inner harmonies and counterpoint,
                bridging the bright sound of violins and the deeper sounds of the cellos, and was essential in Baroque orchestral and chamber music.

            <h3>Baroque Cello</h3>
            <p>The Baroque cello provided the foundation for bass lines and harmony in ensembles, often forming part of
                the basso continuo group alongside the harpsichord or organ. Its warm, resonant tone supported both orchestral
                works and chamber music, anchoring the harmonic structure of Baroque compositions.

            <h3>Double Bass</h3>
            <p>The Baroque double bass provided the lowest harmonies in ensembles, reinforcing the bass lines and supporting the
                continuo group along with cello and harpsichord. Its deep, resonant tone anchored both orchestral and chamber works,
                creating a solid foundation for Baroque compositions.

            <h3>Recorder / Flute</h3>
            <p>Baroque wind instruments like the recorder and the flute were often used for melodic lines and solo passages.
                The recorder, in particular, was highly popular for chamber music, well-known for its sweet, expressive tone,
                agile way, and ability to blend beautifully with strings and continuo instruments.

            <h3>Baroque Trumpet</h3>
            <p>The Baroque trumpet was primarily used in ceremonial, festive, and courtly music. Lacking the modern valves, it relied
                on the player’s control of natural harmonics to produce different notes. Its bright sound added
                grandeur to orchestral and ceremonial works.
